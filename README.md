Use the SwiftUI Kit to see how SwiftUI views appear and interact when using the system defaults. You can view the source to see how particular examples work.

Includes Buttons, Colors, Controls, Fonts, Haptics, Images, Indicators, Shapes, and Text. 

#### To run
Make sure you're using [Xcode 12+](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) as well as a device running iOS 14+. Works on iPhone and iPad.

#### Accent color
To change the accent color and see how it affects the system components, go to the AccentColor section of Assets.xcassets in Xcode. You can then change the Light and Dark accent colors that will be applied to the app.
